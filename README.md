The Wayde App is a React application that aims to explore, test, and document the best practices on React. This project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to create safer programs and more informative source code. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Committing Command

This project uses [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) and [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to actively practice the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Use the command `git com` instead of `git commit -m '...'`. As the workspace environment is established by the yarn lifecycle event, an interactive CLI menu will prompt you with a dialog to enter any necessary information.
